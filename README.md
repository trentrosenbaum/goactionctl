# GoActionCTL

This is a small CLI to generate an initial starting point for writing a GitHub Action in Golang.
The CLI binary will clone a basic working example of the [Golang GitHub Action](https://github.com/trentrosenbaum/my-golang-action) 
into a new project directory named by the user.

```sh
> ./bin/goactionctl <my project name>
```
